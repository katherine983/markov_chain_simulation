    "### In depth breakdown of entropy_rate() code\n",
    "The entropy_rate() function requires the steady state probability vector and transition probability matrix as numpy arrays. Because the initiation process of the GMTP class only generates a transition matrix of transition frequencies stored as a dictionary, the process for calculating the entropy rate of the MC model first must convert the transition matrix to a numpy array, convert the transition frequency counts to transition probabilities, and then compute the steady state probabilities via eigendecomposition. This process is completed by the GMTP.eig_steadystate() method. "

    "See that the transition frequency counts of the square $3^1 x 3^1$ matrix are stored as a dictionary in pincus.tranexp. Each key in the dictionary is a tuple in the format (('a',), ('a',)), where the first element is a tuple of the present state/s, and the second element is a tuple of the future state/s. For higher order Markov chains with order $k>1$ and number of states $a$ in the state space, this matrix is an expanded matrix of $a^k x a^k$ transitions. "
