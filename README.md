# markov_chain_simulation
Code to randomly generate Markov transition matrices of order 1-6, generate markov chains of a certain length from the transition matrix, 
calculate the stationary probabilities of process, the entropy rate, and save to a json file.

To use:

Use the GenMarkovTransitionProb class from gen_mc_transition.py to generate, store, save, and load saved markov transition matrices, as well as compute some basic statistics for the matrix.
